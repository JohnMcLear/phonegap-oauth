phonegap-oauth
==============

This is a Zepto and jQuery plugin to create OAuth buttons.

The idea is to provide an easy, fast and reliable OAuth authentication for HTML5 / PhoneGap apps with ChildBrowser and also support windows popups (offline development without the need of a phone/emulator).

*requires zepto.min.js or jquery.min.js.*

Is also bootstrap compatible <;) (the demo layout actually)
